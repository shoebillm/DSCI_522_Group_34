Summary
=======

In this research project, we tried to answer the research question of
whether the number of graffiti in Vancouver’s Downtown area is the same
as the number of graffiti in Vancouver’s Strathcona area.

Due to the skewness of our sample distribution, we used the median as
the test statistics and set the *α* = 0.05 with the two-tailed
permutation test method to study the difference in the medians.

For statistical analysis, we conducted a simulation with 10000
permutation replicates, plotted the confidence interval of the simulated
null-distribution with the test statistics, and calculated the p-value
to draw the conclusion.

Introduction
============

Here we attempted to conduct a hypothesis test with a suitable test
flavor to answer the statistical research question, that is, whether the
number of graffiti in Vancouver’s downtown area differs from the number
of graffiti in Vancouver’s Strathcona area (City of Vancouver 2020).

We proposed to sequentially perform an exploratory data analysis,
determine what features and columns to be retrieved to support our
hypothesis testing, and attach with a suitable test flavor to verify
whether the median number of graffiti per location of Vancouver’s
downtown area differs from the median number of graffiti per location of
Vancouver’s Strathcona area (Ismay and Kim 2019).

According to the data visualizations, a suitable estimator for our
research question is the median, since we are interested in the most
common numbers of graffiti in the two regions and the median is not
sensitive to extreme values as it is mathematically defined by the the
50th percentile of a distribution (Bzik 2014).

The R and Python programming languages (R Core Team 2020; Van Rossum and
Drake 2009) and the following R and Python packages were used to perform
the analysis: docopt (de Jonge 2018), knitr (Xie 2020), tidyverse
(Wickham et al. 2019), ggplot2 (Wickham 2016), infer (Bray et al. 2020).

Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------------------

The dataset used in this project provides information on the location of
sites with graffiti identified by City staff. It was sourced from the
Vancouver Open Data Portal, specifically [this
file](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/graffiti/information).
The license of data can be found
[here](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/).

There are 8,028 rows and 3 columns in our dataset. Each row in the
dataset records the number of graffiti incidents by the geographic area
of Vancouver along with the spatial representation of the location by
coordinates stored in JSON format.

We are investigating 2 local areas of Vancouver; they are the ‘Downtown’
and the ‘Strathcona’ regions, and there are 2,121 observations related
to our research interest. After conducting the exploratory data
analysis, we chose the median as the estimator. From the above violin
plot of the distributions of two classes, we can observe the sample
distributions are skewed to the right. The long right tail of the
distributions also makes the median a suitable test flavor, since the
median is not sensitive to extreme values as it is mathematically
defined by the 50th percentile of a distribution.

Statistical Analysis
--------------------

To estimate the sampling distribution of the test statistic we need many
samples generated under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is
true, changing the exposure would have no effect on the outcome. By
randomly shuffling the exposures we can make up as many ‘null’ data sets
as we like. If the null hypothesis is true, the shuffled data sets
should look similar to the real data. Otherwise, they should look
different from the real data. Comparing the shuffled test statistics to
the real test statistics gives a p-value. Then, we compared the p-value
with our defined threshold *α* = 0.05 to draw the conclusion for our
research question.

**Estimator:**  
The median of the number of graffiti per recorded location

**Hypothesis**  
*H*<sub>0</sub>: The median of the number of graffiti per recorded
location of Vancouver’s Downtown area is the same as the median of the
number of graffiti per recorded location of Vancouver’s Strathcona area

*H*<sub>*a*</sub>: The median of the number of graffiti per recorded
location of Vancouver’s Downtown area is not the same as the median of
the number of graffiti per recorded location of Vancouver’s Strathcona
area

**Test Flavor**  
Two-tailed permutation test for the median.

**Test Statistics**  
We used delta to represent the difference between the median counts of
graffiti in each area.

Results & Discussion
--------------------

First we calculated the median values of the counts in the 2 areas of
our interest. The medians of the counts of graffiti per location in the
two areas are listed below:

| geo\_local\_area | median\_count |
|:-----------------|--------------:|
| Downtown         |             3 |
| Strathcona       |             3 |

Table 1. Results of computed median values of the 2 classes

To look at whether our null hypothesis is valid, we conducted a
simulation with 10000 permutation replicates of the differences in
medians. The figure below visualizes the simulated null distribution
with the test statistics.

Then, we calculated the corresponding p-value of the null distribution
for drawing the conclusion:

| delta\_sample | p\_value |
|--------------:|---------:|
|             0 |        1 |

Table 2. The corresponding p-value of the null hypothesis

The test statistics is 0 for the sample. The calculated p-value is 1,
which is larger than 0.05. It indicated that there is no statistically
significant difference between the medians of counts of graffiti per
recorded location in the 2 areas in Vancouver. We don’t have enough
confidence to reject the null hypothesis that the median of the number
of graffiti per recorded location of Vancouver’s Downtown area is the
same as the median of the number of graffiti per recorded location of
Vancouver’s Strathcona area.

Future work includes further exploratory data analysis to take full
advantage of the coordinate data on the map, and to understand the
distribution of graffiti in different areas of Vancouver. Analyzing the
Downtown and Strathcona areas is a bit segmentary to represent the whole
regional situation of Vancouver. We would study and observe the graffiti
numbers and differences in other areas based on a more macroscopic
perspective. Another hypothesis testing might be conducted as a
statistical analysis comparison of our current permutation test.
Meanwhile, we would also improve the preprocessing to eliminate
redundant and unrepresentative data points since there are many zero
values in Downtown and Strathcona areas, leading to a very centralized
distribution.
